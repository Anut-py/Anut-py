# Hello!

I mainly use Java Spring Boot and Angular 8 for making webapps.

I know Python, Java, and web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS, Typescript, Angular).

My itch.io account is [here](https://itch.io/profile/anut).

I have made these apps:
- [The Inner Workings of the Cell](https://anut-py.github.io/cells/) (School project)
- [Earth Advertisement](https://anut-py.github.io/earth-advertisement/home) (School project)
- [The Structures of Ancient Egypt](https://anut-py.github.io/egypt-project/home) (School project)
- [Anut's Platformer](https://anut.itch.io/anuts-platformer) (Game)
- [Jumpie Tingie](https://anut.itch.io/jumpie-tingie) (Game)
- [Online Sequence Game](https://sequence-hackathon.herokuapp.com) (Hackathon / 10 week project)

The last project was made with [PYee1999](https://github.com/PYee1999) and [CYee3589](https://github.com/CYee3589).

It was organized by [Beltran02148](https://github.com/Beltran02148). The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/PYee1999/sequence-hackathon).

I am also working on an application called the Wealth Management Platform. It is under development. I am working with the people mentioned above
and [lesteryee](https://github.com/lesteryee). The website is live at https://wealth-mp.github.io/wmp.
